    "Toast Bread strategy is a strategy that I came up with, which utilizes the limited future insight that keeps flowing when time progresses. It consists of 2 stages: stage A where the agent creates a plan and stage B/C where the agent acts upon the newly came future insight. Before explaining the underlying logic, first lets talk about a scenario where our trained models make predictions for the 8 upcoming time-series data with 6 hours intervals. It predicts 4 features for each interval: open, close, low and high. So our future-insight is in this format: [d1.0-6, d1.6-12, d1.12-18, d1.18-24, d2.0-6, d2.6-12, d2.12-18, d2.18-24] where di.s-e means ith day's [open, close, low, end] information for the interval between start hour s and end hour h.\n",
    "And these are the terms for having common ground on the explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "'slice' is a 6 hour interval, it contains an open and a close price that is at the start and end of the 6 hour interval. And it contains low and high prices which are the lowest and highest prices the coin has achieved in this interval. We don't have any time information about these two. 'di.s-e' is a slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "'sandwich' is consecutive slices back to back. A single slice is not a sandwich.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we set all of our buy and sell orders with an error margin. Lets say the coin comes 100$ close to our prediction price, then we take the action, and if it doesn't we don't do anything. Below is how the strategy works step by step:\n",
    "\n",
